# pattern-wise-dsa
A curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems categorized by underlying patterns. This repository tracks my journey in mastering problem-solving techniques rather than just memorizing solutions.
# DSA Blueprint 🧩


Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms by focusing on **problem-solving patterns** rather than rote memorization. This repository serves as a personal reference for the core templates used in technical interviews and competitive programming.

## 🧩 The Methodology

Most algorithmic problems share a common DNA. This repo organizes solutions by their underlying logic (Pattern) rather than their data structure. By mastering a single pattern, we unlock the ability to solve hundreds of related problems.

## 📂 Pattern Directory

Each folder contains a conceptual breakdown, time/space complexity analysis, and optimized implementations.

### ⛓️ Linear & Pointer-Based
* **Two Pointers:** Dealing with sorted arrays or linked lists.
* **Sliding Window:** Optimization for sub-arrays and sub-strings.
* **Fast & Slow Pointers:** Cycle detection and finding midpoints.

### 🌳 Hierarchical & Recursive
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Level-order traversal and shortest paths.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Pathfinding and exhaustive search.
* **Backtracking:** Generating permutations and combinations.

### 🏗️ Advanced Structures
* **Monotonic Stack:** Finding the "next greater" or "previous smaller" element.
* **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Efficient string searching and prefix matching.
* **Union Find:** Disjoint set operations and connectivity.

### 📈 Optimization
* **Dynamic Programming:** Overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure.
* **Greedy:** Local optimum leads to global optimum.
