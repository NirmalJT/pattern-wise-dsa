# pattern-wise-dsa
A curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems categorized by underlying patterns. This repository tracks my journey in mastering problem-solving techniques rather than just memorizing solutions.
# DSA Blueprint 🧩

Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms by focusing on reusable patterns. Instead of solving 1,000 individual problems, I am focusing on the ~20 core patterns that solve them all.

## 🛠 Progress Tracker

| Pattern | Status | Key Problems |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Two Pointers | 🟢 | Pair Sum, Remove Duplicates |
| Sliding Window | 🟡 | Max Subarray, Longest Substring |
| Fast & Slow Pointers | 🔴 | Linked List Cycle, Happy Number |
| Merge Intervals | 🔴 | Insert Interval, Meeting Rooms |
| Top K Elements | 🔴 | Kth Largest Element |

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each pattern folder contains a logic breakdown and my solutions in [Insert Language, e.g., Python/Java].
